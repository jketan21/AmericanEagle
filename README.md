BDDAssignment

Added automated test for 3 used cases (VISA/MASTERCARD/AMEX) using BDD framework. Wrote one test which reuses the code to run 3 times. All the locators and data is stored in object repository and loaded using property file. We can have a base configuration class when we can instantiate properties and load it in every test class when implementing the framework, but in this test I have direct instantiated in test class just to show how can we do. Also I cousd have used CSS selector as element locator but looks like the IDs are auto generated, therefore have use XPATH but in the broaded perspective we can implement code to habdle auto generated part of the locator. But for now I have used full xpaths, even if it is little bit slower, it will not break the test case even if underneath attribute values are changed. We can add lots of tests using BDD but because of less time I am able to just demo one tes with thre different data points for each card.
